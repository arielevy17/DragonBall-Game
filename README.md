A game inspired by the well-known animation Dragon Ball!

Review:
The user moves our game with half of the keyboard. 
When the user must collect all seven Dragon Balls, and avoid the energy balls that the opponent shoots at him each time from a different place.
If time the opponent moves faster and the level of difficulty increases.

** The game is written in Java using the Swing library **
